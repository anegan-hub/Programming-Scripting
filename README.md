# Program - bmi.py

This program is basesd on statements.
A statement is an instruction that the python interper can execute i.e 'print'. 

The program calculates a person's Body Mass Index (BMI)
Two variables are created as inputs; built in function float is used, as the input will be a floating number not an integar.

'''
    weight = float(input("Enter Weight in Kilograms: "))
    height = float(input("Enter Height in Centimeter "))

'''
A variable is then created called BMI. The variable takes the inputs and applies the calculation.

'''
    BMI = weight / ((height / 100)**2) 
'''
In addition to this, i included the if, elif, and  else function statements to categorise the result. 

Running the program on the command line you will be asked to input your weight and height. The output would look that this; 

'''
    Î» python bmi.py
    Enter Weight in Kilograms: 53.5
    Enter Height in Centimeters: 162
Y   our BMI is: 20.39. You are a Healthy weight
